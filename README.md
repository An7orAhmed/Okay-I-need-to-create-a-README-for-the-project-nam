Okay, I need to create a README for the project named '3. Remote Health Care'. The user specified that the project uses C/C++/Arduino/Proton Basic. Let me start by generating a meaningful title. The title should be under 50 characters. "Remote Health Monitoring System" sounds good and is concise.

Next, the description. The code snippets show sensors for smoke, temperature, and pulse, with GSM for data transmission. So the description should mention real-time monitoring, the sensors used, and remote data transmission. Also, it's an IoT system for healthcare.

The user wants a pinmap included if possible. Looking at the healthcare.ino code, pins are defined for buzzer, pulse sensor, GSM, and LCD. Let me list those out. For example, Buzzer is on pin 9, the pulse sensor button on pin 4. The LCD uses pins 12, 11, 13, A3, A4, A5. The GSM module uses SoftwareSerial on pins 3 (RX) and 2 (TX). Also, analog sensors are on A0 (smoke), A1 (temperature), and A2 (pulse). I'll organize this into a clear table.

Adding a note about the diagram inaccuracies. The user mentioned that if a diagram is included, to note it may not be accurate. Maybe right after the pinmap.

Don't include contribution or license sections. So skip those parts.

List of PDFs wasn't provided, so maybe ignore that unless the user includes some, but they just mentioned to list them. But the original input didn't specify any PDF names, so perhaps it's a mistake. I might not include that section.

Now, the code structure: explain the main components from the setup and loop. The setup initializes GSM, LCD, pins. The loop reads sensors, displays data, sends to server. The functions like read_sensor, GSM_init, send2Server. Mention calibration steps for each sensor.

Important notes: buzzer triggers based on thresholds, HTTP requests to send data. Maybe mention the dependencies like SoftwareSerial and LiquidCrystal libraries.

Putting it all together: Title, description, features, pinmap with notes, code structure explaining the main parts, dependencies, and important notes about functionality. Avoid any markdown beyond what's needed, keep it clean and organized.
# Remote Health Monitoring System  

## Description  
IoT-based system for real-time health monitoring using smoke, temperature, and pulse sensors. Collects data via an Arduino-powered device, displays metrics on an LCD, and transmits results to a remote server via GSM for remote analysis. Designed for emergency alerts using threshold-based buzzer activation.  

---

## Features  
- **Smoke Detection**: MQ-2 sensor (analog).  
- **Body Temperature Monitoring**: LM35 sensor (calibrated).  
- **Pulse Measurement**: Optical pulse sensor with button activation.  
- **Alerts**: Buzzer triggers for abnormal temperature (>103°F), high smoke levels (>60%), or elevated pulse (>100 BPM).  
- **GSM Integration**: Sends data to a web server for remote access.

## Code Overview  
### `healthcare.ino`  
1. **Setup**:  
   - Initializes GSM module, LCD, and sensors.  
   - Configures buzzer and pulse sensor pins.  
   - Establishes GPRS connectivity via `GSM_init()`.  

2. **Main Loop**:  
   - Reads sensor values using `read_sensor()`.  
   - Displays data on LCD (smoke %, temperature °F, pulse BPM).  
   - Transmits data to a remote server every 5 seconds via `send2Server()`.  

3. **Sensor Calibration**:  
   - **Temperature**: Adjusted using `temp_adjust` offset.  
   - **Pulse**: Mapped from analog ADC range (400-600) to BPM (40-120).  
   - **Smoke**: Scaled from raw ADC (0-250) to percentage (0-100%).  

4. **Alerts**:  
   - Buzzer activates if any sensor exceeds safety thresholds.

## Dependencies  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `SoftwareSerial` (GSM communication).  
  - `LiquidCrystal` (LCD interface).

## Notes  
- **Server Integration**: Data is sent to `http://iothealthcare.000webhostapp.com/connect.php` with query parameters for smoke, temperature, and pulse values.  
- **Calibration**: Adjust `temp_adjust` or pulse mapping values based on hardware testing.  
- **Safety**: Triggers are experimental—verify thresholds for clinical accuracy.
